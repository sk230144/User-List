# Node.js Backend Project

This is a Node.js backend project that serves as the server-side component of your application. It can be started using the following commands:

- `npm run dev` for development mode with automatic code reloading.
- `npm start` for production mode.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Node.js: Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- npm (Node Package Manager): npm is included with Node.js, so you don't need to install it separately.
